* Implemented in C++ for speed
* Optimized for heterogeneous clusters with a adaptive block scheduler
* Functional ideology (map, reduce, groupByKey, coGroup etc)
* Built-in bulk functions (bulkMap, bulkReduce etc)
* OpenMP parallelization
* MPI message passing (?)
* Possible to use with Cuda/OpenCL
