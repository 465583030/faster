####Super Fast Distributed Computing

http://mtcs.github.io/faster

Faster is a distributed computing framework designed to be fast, efficient and flexible. It is designed to work well in small and large heterogeneous clusters. Although, we are still in heavy development.


__Features:__

* High level distributed computing framework.
* Implemented in C++ for speed. 
* Optimized for heterogeneous clusters with a dynamic balancing of data blocks.
* Functional ideology similar to Apache Spark(map, reduce, flatMap, groupByKey, cogroup etc).
* Built-in bulk functions (bulkMap, bulkReduce etc).
* Minimal memmory usage.
* OpenMP parallelization.
* MPI message passing.
* Easy to use with Cuda/OpenCL.
