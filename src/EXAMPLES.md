Faster has full working examples at src/examples directory.

__Some toy examples:__

- fexample-int.cpp - A example applying map and reduce to a faster::fdd <int> created from memory
- fexample-int-file.cpp - A example applying map and reduce to a faster::fdd <int> created from
file
- fexample-int-vector.cpp - A example applying map and reduce to a faster::fdd <vector<int>>
created from memory
- fexample-indexed.cpp - A example applying map and reduce to a faster::indexedFdd <int,int>
created from memory
